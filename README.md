Module 7: Employee Database with SQL

## Assignment Overview

Becoming familiar with relational databases and how to write queries to combine/separate data in tables was the main purpose of this project.
By filtering and joining multiple tables I created via pgAdmin, my goal is to find employee data in Pewlett Hackard's database in order to find soon-to-retire employees and to find a solution for this 'silver tsunami.'

## Retirement Titles and Unique Titles - Deliverable 1
The following screenshots show the queries written to obtain three csv tables - retirement_titles, unique_titles and retiring_titles.
NOTE: The screenshots of the tables do not show the entire table. Please refer to the csv files located in the 'Data' folder of this project.

* ![Unique Titles](https://github.com/yaejinpark/pewlett-hackard-analysis/blob/main/Resources/unique_titles.png)

* ![Retiring Titles](https://github.com/yaejinpark/pewlett-hackard-analysis/blob/main/Resources/retiring_titles.png)

These three tables were created in this order to first find the employees of retirement age (retirement titles), filter out repeating employees due to change in title (unique titles) and find the final count of each retirees in each unique title.

## Mentorship Eligibility - Deliverable 2

The following screenshots show the query written to obtain the table of employees that are eligible for mentorship and the table itself exported as a csv file. Please refer to the mentorship_eligibility.csv for full data as the screenshot does not show the full table.
