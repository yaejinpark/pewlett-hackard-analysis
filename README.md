Module 7: Employee Database with SQL

## Assignment Overview

Becoming familiar with relational databases and how to write queries to combine/separate data in tables was the main purpose of this project.
By filtering and joining multiple tables I created via pgAdmin, my goal is to find employee data in Pewlett Hackard's database in order to find soon-to-retire employees and to find a solution for this 'silver tsunami.'
